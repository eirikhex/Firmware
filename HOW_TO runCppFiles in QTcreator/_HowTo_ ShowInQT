The program must be viewable in QT. In order to do this, follow these steps: 

1) go to src/Firmware/cmake/configs
2) Open nuttx_px4fmu-v2_default.cmake 
3) Somewhere in this file, insert <src_subfolder_name>/<folder_name>, similar to what you already entered in CMakeLists 
(see HowToMakeCMakeLists.txt if you are not certain what this means)
